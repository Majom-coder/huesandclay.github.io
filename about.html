    <p class="roboto-parag">Hi, I’m Maria Jose Turitich, the creator behind Hues and Clay. What started as a creative escape during COVID-19 quickly became a passion. I never thought of myself as "good with my hands," but working with polymer clay turned into a relaxing therapy for my anxiety and a love for crafting unique jewelry.

        As I shared my creations, I realized the joy of making polymer jewelry could be just as fulfilling for others. That inspired me to not only sell my pieces but also teach others through workshops. I’m excited to be working on DIY kits, so you can enjoy the therapeutic experience of jewelry making from home or at your next craft party.
        
        Though the kits are still in development, I’m grateful for the support I’ve received and can’t wait to share more soon</p>
